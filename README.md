## Purpose

Our aim is to make the work we've done on comparing the monitoring and mitigation between commercial scale offshore wind farms on the Eastcoast of the US available to wider audiences. Our work is aimed at informing developers and policy makers on the extent and nature of monitoring and mitigation measures required for offshore wind projects. We also hope this work can be the jumping off point for additional works that compare the levels of commitment between projects on a level beyond measure counts. Our data set serves as a snapshot in time of the state of US offshore wind development as of summer 2023. Due to the rapidly developing nature of this industry and our developing understanding of the effects of offshore wind we urge against the extrapolation of our results however hope that they can become a guide to future efforts in the field.

Questions on data set use, analysis, and general offshore wind topics is always encouraged. I'll do me best to respond in a timely manner.
